        <h1>Welcome to use PerlDB!</h1>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in this project.</p>
        <h2>What is PerlDB?</h2>
        <p>PerlDB is a light weight relational database engine built entirely in Perl programming language.</p>
        <h2>Primary Features</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Create, rename and delete table</li>
            <li>Add, rename, and delete column</li>
            <li>Insert, update, delete row</li>
            <li>Primary key, foreign key constraints</li>
            <li>Referential integrity: update restricted and delete restricted</li>
            <li>Customised table triggers</li>
            <li>Basic transaction and concurrency management</li>
            <li>Transaction log</li>
            <li>Shared lock and exclusive lock on table</li>
            <li>Relational algebras: Select, Project, Cross, Join, Redefine</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Highlights</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pure Perl implementation</li>
            <li>Data files are well-formatted to be human readable</li>
            <li>Thus, can easily be processed by any text processing language</li>
            <li>Tiny memory print: almost all table operations are done on disk</li>
            <li>Well documented and commented code</li>
            <li>Very compact design and thus very small in size</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>When do you need PerlDB?</h2>
        <p>PerlDB is very compact and easy to understand, thus it is an ideal choice when you need to customize some behaviors of a relational database engine. It offers many functions which are not seen on other similar sized DB engines, such as human-readable data file, customized table triggers and support for transaction and concurrency management.</p>
        <h2>Current Status</h2>
        <p>Most functions are working-in-progress. Stay turned please :)</p>
        <h2>Why did I want to make this?</h2>
        <p>As a Perl learner, I thought I would make something that both makes me practice most of Perl features and being potentially useful, thus I came out with this idea.</p>
